# Flavor Wheel

### Description

Flavor Wheel is a tool for planning delicious and cohesive meals by building dishes from their basic elements of salt, fat, acid, heat, and spice. Flavor Wheel will visualize flavors as a zoomable sunburst that displays two levels of hierarchy at a time. By successively clicking on elements in the innermost wheel, users will be able to add elements that complement the items they have already selected. Flavor Wheel is meant to be a more dynamic version of its inspiration, Wendy McNaughton’s watercolor drawings in Samin Nosrat’s cookbook Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat (see example below).

### Functionality

Users can click on sections of the wheel to add an element to their dish.
Upon click, the wheel will zoom in to reveal another wheel of elements associated with the element already added.
All of the user’s selected dish elements appear in the center of the wheel.
Clicking the center of the wheel removes an element and shifts the wheel back one level of hierarchy.
